Title: recursive-count

Modules:
solution.recurse(count, callback)
    -takes in two parameters, count and callback then it counts down to zero recursively
    -checks for null values in the count and callback parameters
    -ensures that count is a number
    -ensures that callback is a function
    -ensures that count is not less than 1

## Whiteboard Challenge 06

Write a recursive function called loop that has the function signature (count, callback) => undefined It should call the callback count times (count is expected to be > 0)

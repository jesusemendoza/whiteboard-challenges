===

## Requirements
The fibonacci series is an ordering of numbers where each number is the sum of the preceeding two.
* Write two functions to print out the nth entry in the fibonacci series, **recursively and iteratively**

ex: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34] forms the first ten entries of the fibonacci series

ex: fib(4) === 3

Write at least four tests for each function (they will generally cover the same IO for each function)
* your tests should cover basic (*expected*) functionality
* your tests should consider edge cases for your function (ex: will your function still operate on an array of floating point integers?)

In your README.md explain why you would NOT use recursion to solve fibonacci, even though you CAN.
